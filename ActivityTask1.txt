2. Difference between http1.1 and http2

HTTP : HyperText Transfer Protocol
http --> Works over TCP(transfer control protocol)
Http1.1 :=
==============
* Published in the year of 1997
* Prioritization  -> In this version loading issuse found, like if js file have heavy memory file, then complete website need to waited .. user thinks that website is not working
* In this, 6 request are Parallelely sent for one time hand shaking (three hand shaking) 
* Header implemented


Http2  :=
=============
* Published in the year of 2015
* Prioritization
* In this, all request send with an specific time stamp  for all incoming request hence  only one time hand shaking is done(three hand shaking). So, probably time consumes less
* Header implemented


3. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

  Objects:
  ==========
   * Objects is an collection of key and value pairs 
     e.g: name : "mohan"
       where name --> Key  
             mohan --> Value
  * Objects is an one of the datatype in Javascript which rely on key-value pairs
  Syntax:-
  ==========
  var studentDetails = {
      name : "Keshav",
      age : 20,
      city : "hosur",
      gender : "male"
  }

  To access the members of object following can be done:

  var nameValue = studentDetails.name;
  var ageValue = studentDetails.age;
  console.log(nameValue);
 console.log(ageValue);

(Object is an call-by-reference in nature:)
Like if we assign another variable to same object name it will not copy the values . Instead it will copy of studentDetails reference objects
  eg:
    var duplicateStudentDetails = studentDetails;
      --> this duplicateStudentDetails objects also refernce to studentDetails only .. it will not create new values...
